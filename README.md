This is a C# dll implementation of NIST SP 800-232 ipd Ascon-Based Lightweight Cryptography Standards for Constrained Devices [1]. Some constants, like number of rounds etc, were taken from the original Ascon Submission v1.2 [2], and will be revived according to the new standard as soon as possible.
