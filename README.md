This is a C# dll implementation of [NIST SP 800-232 ipd Ascon-Based Lightweight Cryptography Standards for Constrained Devices](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-232.ipd.pdf). Some constants, like number of rounds etc, were taken from the original [Ascon Submission v1.2](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00145-021-09398-9.pdf), and will be revived according to the new standard as soon as possible.

Note that **NO TEST VECTORS** are present at the moment. Therefore, the output is most likely not correct. I will check the code from time to time for logic and coding errors. When the test vectors are published,  I will assure the code is correct. Till then, beware of possible errors.
